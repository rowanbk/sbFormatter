Turn sideboard documents in printable SB maps

Using CyrusCG's sideboard plan formatting from google docs this will create a more readable printer friendly version. Make sure to always use full card names (eg. Empty the Warrens not ETW). If you do want to abbreviate a card name add it to the abbrs.txt file in the format: Proper Name/Short. Eg:
Empty the Warrens/ETW
