~ Miracles
-1 Dark Petition, -1 Cabal Ritual, -1 Rain of Filth
+1 Tendrils of Agony +2 Abrupt Decay  (If they Surgical and see no Xantid/Empty G2 you are safe to bring them in. Cuts can be a Bloodstained Mire, more mana, or Dark Petitions. Depending on if you think they have RiP/Relic)

~ BUG Midrange
 -1 Rain of Filth, -1 Preordain, -1 Dark Petition
+2 Abrupt Decay, +1 Empty the Warrens (I am medium on Empty. But without DRS they can’t really race it and it is an option to beat Leovold.

 + 1 Xantid Swarm, +2 Flusterstorm, +2 Tormod’s Crypt (if they aggressively fetch Iona over Griselbrand go ahead and bring in Chain of Vapor for the other Dark Petition and a Preordain. They won’t do this if they are good though.)

~ Elves:
  -1 Rain of Filth, -1 Swamp, -2 Dark Petition
  + 2 Chain of Vapor, +2 Flusterstorm (Adjust if they don’t have Leyline of the Void/Natural Order)


~ Manaless Dredge:
 -1 Swamp, -1 Rain of Filth, -1 Preordain
+1 Xantid, +2 Tormod’s Crypt (Same as always, shave Dark Petition if you see Leyline of the Void)


~ LED Dredge
-4 Thoughtseize, -1 Swamp, -1 Rain of  Filth
+2 Fluster, +2 Chain of Vapor, +2 Tormod’s Crypt












~  Stoneblade:
- 2 Dark Petition, -1 Cabal Ritual
 +1 Tendrils of Agony, +2 Abrupt Decay (I sometimes bring in Xantid against UW Blade but never Esper. It also gains value if they Surgical you game 2 and see 0 Empty 0 Xantid because they will almost certainly board out removal of all kinds. If you see Meddling Mage and no RiP, Dark Petition should stay in your deck. You can shave Preordains,  Petals, or a Misty)


~ RUG/Grixis Delver
 -1 Ad Nauseam, -1 Petition
 +1 Tendrils of Agony, +1 Empty the Warrens (Sometimes I cut Preordain for Flusterstorm)


~ Merfolk
 - 2 Dark Petition, -1 Preordain
 +2 Abrupt Decay,  +1 Xantid Swarm (This sucks. We have to board out a lot of business because they have FoW and Chalice. Gotta get a little lucky here)


~  Red Stompy
 -3 Duress, -2 Dark Petition, -2 Preordain
  +2 Abrupt Decay, +2 Echoing Truth, +2  Chain of Vapor, +1 Empty the Warrens (I really do not like Empty against this deck but I think it is a necessary evil. Just accept that you are going to lose to sweepers or Rabblemaster and bite the bullet. If you see sweepers past Confluence and you don’t don’t see Leyline of the Void feel free to add back Dark Petition or add the third Decay, Decay also gains value if you see Scab-Clan Beserker) 


~ Grixis Control:
-1 Swamp, -1 Rain of Filth, -1 Dark Petition, -1 Lotus Petal
+1 Empty the Warrens, +2 Fluster, +1 Tendrils of Agony

 +2 Chain of Vapor, +2 Fluster, +2 Tormod’s Crypt


~ Turbo Depths:
   -2 Dark Petition  +2 Chain of Vapor (Adjust accordingly if you need more answers to Sphere. Duress and Swamp are fine cuts. I also sometimes like Fluster in this matchup, I’m not sure if it is better than Duress)
